# Link API

Link API is the backend service powering the [Link](https://github.com/thanwannahtun/link) mobile application. It facilitates seamless communication between the mobile frontend and the server, enabling functionalities such as:

- **Route Management**: Allows travel agencies to create, update, and delete travel routes, schedules, and pricing.
- **User Authentication**: Supports secure user registration and login for both agencies and travelers.
- **Data Retrieval**: Provides endpoints for travelers to search and view available routes based on origin, destination, and schedule.
